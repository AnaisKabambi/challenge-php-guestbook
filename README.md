# What is this
This is an [exercise](https://github.com/becodeorg/ANT-Lamarr-5.34/tree/main/2.The-Hill/php/5.php-guestbook) from the coaches at Becode to learn to work with PHP.

# Timeline
1. Make a form  ✔️ *3.11.2021*
    * Make sure the form can handle attacks (use htmlspecialchars())
2. Get the input from the form ✔️ *3.11.2021*
    * Use min. 2 classes (PostLoader and Post)
3. Store the data in a file
    * Use file_put_contents() (i think)
    * convert array to a string to store (use json_encode())
4. Display the data
    * New (top) to old (bottom)
    * Display all elements (title, date, message, author name)
    * Only show last 20 posts
